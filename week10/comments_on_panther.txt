Mitoferrin-1 encodes a protein responsible for the transport of ferrous iron across the membrane separating the mitochondrial intermembrane space from the mitochondrial matrix.  It might be upregulated during differentiation in association with the increased mitochondrial activity required to fuel the ATP-driven processess occurring during late differentiation.
